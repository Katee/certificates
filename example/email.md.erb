===============================================================

Dear <%= attendee.name %>,

It was great to see you at our conference.  
Please not the 2 empty spaces at the end of each sentence to ensure a line break.  
Or the double line breaks for paragraph and the ability to put a link. You can find more styles you can apply at http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax. Please note that this file will be interpreted by ERB (replacing the attendee.name)) and sent as the text part of your email. Markdown will generate the HTML part.

Enjoy it!
